abstract: Raw audit logs provide a comprehensive record of clinicians' activities on an electronic health record (EHR) and have considerable potential for studying clinician behaviors. However, research using raw audit logs is limited because they lack context for clinical tasks, leading to difficulties in interpretation. We describe a novel unsupervised approach using the comparison and visualization of EHR action embeddings to learn context and structure from raw audit log activities. Using a dataset of 15 767 634 raw audit log actions performed by 88 intern physicians over 6 months of EHR use across inpatient and outpatient settings, we demonstrated that embeddings can be used to learn the situated context for EHR-based work activities, identify discrete clinical workflows, and discern activities typically performed across diverse contexts. Our approach represents an important methodological advance in raw audit log research, facilitating the future development of metrics and predictive models to measure clinician behaviors at the macroscale.

summary: Audit logs have great potential for studying the EHR-based workflows and work habits of physicians and other healthcare professionals. However, one major barrier is the granularity of the data, which makes identification of discrete clinical tasks difficult. In this paper, we describe a novel unsupervised approach using the comparison and visualization of EHR action embeddings to learn context and structure from raw audit log activities, which can be useful for task identification and annotation.
