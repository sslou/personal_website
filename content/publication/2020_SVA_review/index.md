abstract: The sinuses of Valsalva are outpouchings in the aortic root just distal to the aortic valve that serve several physiologic functions. Aneurysm of this segment of the aorta is quite rare and infrequently encountered in clinical practice. Due to the rarity of sinus of Valsalva aneurysms, there is a lack of controlled trials and most of the literature consists of case reports and series. Here, the authors review the currently available literature to discuss the anatomy and normal function of the aortic root, as well as disease pathology and diagnostic imaging considerations. Using reported cases, the authors also will discuss considerations for cardiac anesthesiologists in the perioperative period.
